# Manager

Managers are simply zabbix hosts in which you will define the parameters of the cloud region you want to monitor.

Once a manager is properly configured and active no further action is required in Zabbix and CloudMon will automatically create/remove/update zabbix hosts according to the events of the Cloud.

CloudMon supports several managers simultaneously.
